\arguments{
\item{model}{model}

\item{startingValues}{named vector with starting values}

\item{lambda}{penalty value}

\item{adaptiveLassoWeights}{named vector with adaptive lasso weights}

\item{regularizedParameters}{named vector of regularized parameters}

\item{eta}{if the current step size fails, eta will decrease the step size. Must be > 1}

\item{sig}{GIST: sigma value in Gong et al. (2013). Sigma controls the inner stopping criterion and must be in (0,1). Generally, a larger sigma enforce a steeper decrease in the regularized likelihood while a smaller sigma will result in faster acceptance of the inner iteration.}

\item{initialStepsize}{initial stepsize to be tried in the outer iteration}

\item{stepsizeMin}{Minimal acceptable step size. Must be > 0. A larger number corresponds to a smaller step from one to the next iteration. All step sizes will be computed as described by Gong et al. (2013)}

\item{stepsizeMax}{Maximal acceptable step size. Must be > stepsizeMin. A larger number corresponds to a smaller step from one to the next iteration. All step sizes will be computed as described by Gong et al. (2013)}

\item{GISTLinesearchCriterion}{criterion for accepting a step. Possible are 'monotone' which enforces a monotone decrease in the objective function or 'non-monotone' which also accepts some increase.}

\item{GISTNonMonotoneNBack}{in case of non-monotone line search: Number of preceding regM2LL values to consider}

\item{maxIter_out}{maximal number of outer iterations}

\item{maxIter_in}{maximal number of inner iterations}

\item{break_outer}{stopping criterion for the outer iteration.}

\item{numDeriv}{boolean should numDeriv package be used for derivatives?}

\item{verbose}{set to 1 to print additional information and plot the convergence}

\details{
GIST minimizes a function of form f(theta) = l(theta) + g(theta), where l is the likelihood and g is a penalty function. Various penalties are supported, however currently only lasso and adaptive lasso are implemented.
